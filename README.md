This is a web application based on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The User plays the Computer in a 5 round game and the winner is whoever has the most points after 5 rounds. One of 3 buttons labeled ROCK, PAPER and SCISSORS aids the user in making a selection for the current round. If the User and Computer pick the same action for a specific round no point is given for that round to either player. When the game is over the name of the winner is displayed along with the score and a button labeled PLAY AGAIN? should the user wish to restart the game.

I chose these technologies to create this application as I felt that since this is a small application the React framework, HTML and basic CSS and JavaScript were sufficient to create this project.
